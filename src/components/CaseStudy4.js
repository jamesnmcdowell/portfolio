                        <P>Often smaller farms do not have the resources to sell their products to a larger audience. It is expensive and complicated to build and maintain a sophisticated platform for connecting with customers to sell their products. There are of course a variety of avenues for farmers to reach consumers such as seasonal farmers markets but their location and frequency is highly variable. <strong>The goal is to empower local farmers to connect directly with customers on their own terms.</strong></P>
                        <P>This project was inspired by from my personal experiences. I had been buying unpasteurized milk and other hard to find products from a local farm for quite some time and began to really value having access to unique products from a local farm rather than solely being dependent on traditional retail grocery chains or farmers markets. The farm that I purchase from has a mobile trailer which is parked multiple times throughout the week at different locations during regular time slots  in order to reach a wide variety of customers. The goal of this project is to create a platform to enable this coordination between local farmers and customers that is both extremely easy to operate and free for farmers. </P>
                        <SubTitle>Users</SubTitle>
                        <P>The target user group is local farmers interested in reaching more customers and customers who are interested in buying from local farms.</P>

                <P>To get a better understanding of the local farmers user group, I extensively searched through websites of smaller farmers to research into how they currently were selling their products to consumers. There were a variety of existing ways but there I couldnâ€™t find any platform that would enable a farmer to register to easily have a means for connecting with and potential customers nearby. I spoke with several farmers in the form of unstructured interviews so simply get a understanding of their needs and how my platform could best serve them.</P>

                        <P>Based on my research collected from conducting a competitive analysis and conversations with local farmers, I came up with a series of core tasks that the platform should be able to achieve.</P>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Customers can use predictive search bar to query for products</li>
                            <li>Customers can search for products based on category filtering</li>
                            <li>Customers search results return closest location to them</li>
                            <li>Vendors can create a homepage to display their information</li>
                            <li>Vendors can add both products and selling locations to database</li>
                        </ul>
                        <P>Following this I made a series of wireframes to plot out the various screens and their relationships that would exist within the platform.</P>

                <P>I created the application in a fairly short time-frame (~ 1 week) using React.  I wanted to challenge myself to become familiar with newer technologies so I specifically choose build my node server with Koa.js rather than Express.js and  GraphQl rather than REST.</P>
                <BTitle>The following are the technologies powering the application:</BTitle>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side routing with React Router</li>
                    <li>Authentication using JSON web tokens and bcrypt</li>
                    <li>GraphQL server that enables sophisticated client-side querying</li>
                    <li>State management with Redux</li>
                    <li>Responsive mobile-first CSS Grid/ Flexbox Layout</li>
